# TAMU_classwork

A few of the codes I wrote for class at TAMU. 

The 'Multiphysics' directory contains
1. A solver for the nonlinear 1D heat conduction equation via Newton’s method with FEM
2. A solver for a nonlinear 4-equation point reactor kinetics model using either operator splitting or Newton’s method with Crank-Nicolson as the time integrator

The 'Numerical Methods' directory contains
1. A fourth order ODE two-point boundary value problem solver via FEM with piecewise 3rd degree Hermite polynomials
2. An elliptic BVP solver via FEM with triangular finite elements in space and implicit and explicit Euler methods in time
